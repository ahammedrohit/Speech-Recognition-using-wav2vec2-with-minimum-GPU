# Speech-Recognition-using-wav2vec2-with-minimum-GPU

Python Colab for speech recognition with wav2vec2. Since wav2vec2 requires heavy GPU I've come up with a way to run this on Google Colab as well as local machines with minimum GPU.

Punctuation and Capitalization is also used for better usderstanding of sentences. 

For Testing:

Open in colab.
Make sure to connect colab with GPU.
Paste any youtube ID here : YOUTUBE_ID = 'Paste Here' | Or you can upload your own file in colab.(Make adjustments as necessary)
Run 
You'll find your transcription as well as Word Error Rate(WER) and Character Error Rate(CER)
